    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a straight-to-the-point, consise and fluent talker and love the process of trying to
        understand and explain something new. I am a problem solver by nature and I love a good challenging
        project that takes time, effort, careful planning and optimized implementation to be completed.
        My goal is to constantly be enriching my skills and technical know-how in order to be the best
        in my line of work. My one weak point is that I have less experience working with others than I
        would like to admit and currently work to remedy that.
