<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Theodosios Kavalagios and I am a phycisist by trade. I am an aspiring developer trying to master
  multiple crafts such as website building, python scripting, statistical analysis with R and physics simulations
  with FORTRAN. My dream is to become the best programmer there ever was!
</p>

<p>I grew up in the town of Levadia, Greece. I now am a university student at the National Technical University of 
  Athens. Specifically I study at the School of Applied Mathematics and Physical Sciences. I am now taking a few courses
  on Udemy in order to construct a basic portfolio and to enrich my knowledge and experience in website building, image and
  video editing and 3D modelling and animation.
