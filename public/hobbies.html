    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Language Learner</h2>
    <p> I am very scholarly when it comes to learning foreign languages and
        I love learning about the culture and customs that resulted in the
        language's contemporary form. Getting to know people from a different
        country and being able to communicate with them hase opened my eyes
        to different points of view and expanded my horizons.
    </p>
    <p>I especially am fond of languages that use a non-roman alphabet such as
         Arabic, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Georgian etc. I hope to know
         at least 10 languages by the time I'm 40 years old.
    </p>
    <h2>Electronics Hobbyist</h2>
    <p>I love computers and everything related to them. I consider them the pinnacle
        of human creativity and engineering and I'd love to build my very own computer
        some day with its very own custom operating system and custom made components
        designed by me.
    </p>
    <p>As a 2000s kid I am fascinated by the rate at which technology is progressing and
        make it my mission to have the same level of understanding about electronics that
        old physicists had for electromagnetism. I love the process of creating a circuit,
        building it and executing it commands on it.
    </p>
    <h2>Bookworm</h2>
    <p>I love reading science books. I most recently have become enamored with the history
        of contemporary physics and how technology has been affected/benefited so far.
        I also use book reading as a tool to sharpen my focus and to lengthen my attention span.
    </p>
    <h2>Digital Photo and Video Editing</h2>
    <p>I like to create art and retouch photos of friends and family using GIMP photo editing software,
        as well as edit videos I make for my YT channel using DaVinci Resolve.
        I am not an expert on neither yet but I aim to improve my skills and unleash my creativity through
        them.
    </p>
    <h2>Survival Enthusiast</h2>
    <p>I am a camping enthusiast and therefore I like learning how to survive in the wild. I frequently
        go for hikes in the nearby mountains and try to spend the night in the wild. I believe such skills
        are a lost art and should be essential life knowledge for anyone.
