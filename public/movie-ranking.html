<h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Theodosios's movie recommendations</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Spider-Man 2 (2004)</h3>
<p>Spider-Man 2 is justifiably considered to be one of the best superhero movies of all time.
But not because of the fancy battle scenes or the impressive CGI for its time... because of
how it underlines the human struggles we all go through and can relate, accentuated by the
responsibility of having to protect people as a superhero.</p>
<h3>Toy Story (1995)</h3>
<p>Toy Story is an all-time classic by now, which I believe kids are going to be watching again
and again for years to come. A buddy-cop movie with elements of true friendship, self-acceptance
and teamwork, Toy Story is a serious achievement in storytelling as much as it is a technical marvel
in CGI cinema.

<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>For more mature audiences, I recommend Saving Private Ryan. This movie grounds you to reality
like no other. It establishes a world in which real people are pushed to their limit by the reality
of war and how they find solace into their comradery and companionship. I personally felt like I was
brought along for the ride and I got to explore multi-layered personallities, their struggles and
their dreams. Must watch!
